# Air Quality Analysis Using Neural Networks

This Jupyter notebook explores air quality analysis by predicting carbon monoxide (CO(GT)) levels using various neural network architectures, including Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP). The experiments focus on both model selection and the evaluation of different training algorithms.

## Dataset and Knowledge Preparation

- **Data Source**: The dataset includes 3304 instances of hourly averaged measurements from a multisensor device placed at road level in a polluted city. The sensors include spectrometer analyzers (GT), solid state metal oxide detectors (PT08.Sx), temperature, relative humidity, and absolute humidity sensors.
- **Objective**: Predict the continuous value of CO(GT) which represents the carbon monoxide levels.
- **Missing Data**: Features with missing data are flagged with `-999` and require preprocessing for accurate analysis.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following libraries are installed:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

```bash
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import time
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor
```

## Usage

### Setup
- Ensure all dependencies are installed.
- Download the dataset (`sensor_data.xlsx`) and the Jupyter notebook into the same directory.

### Execution
- Open the notebook in a Jupyter environment.
- Run the notebook cells sequentially to perform data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison of different neural network architectures.

## Experiments

### Simple MLP Model Selection
- **Models Tested**: Various MLP configurations with one or two hidden layers and different activation functions (`relu`, `logistic`).
- **Methodology**: Utilize `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning and model selection based on Mean Squared Error (MSE).

### Training Algorithm Comparison
- **Algorithms Compared**: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and ADAM optimization.
- **Analysis**: Evaluate the performance of both training algorithms over 300 iterations, comparing training loss and MSE on both training and testing datasets.

## Results
- **Model Parameters**: Output the best model parameters and the cross-validation MSE with its standard deviation.
- **Model Evaluation**: Re-train the selected model using the whole training set and evaluate its MSE and RÂ² score on the testing set.
- **Training Dynamics**: Discuss the differences in training dynamics and final performance between SGD and ADAM as optimization algorithms.

## Model Development
- **Robust MLP Regressor**: Develop an MLP regressor that accounts for missing and noisy features.
- **Considerations**: Include handling missing features, noisy data, and a robust model selection practice to ensure generalization.
